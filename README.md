## This is a new branch!
This is a new branch. I encountered errors in my old branch, so I am restarting the project *without* deleting any changes...by using branches.

## I've fixed some things in this branch.
Originally, things weren't working, so I restarted.
Then things weren't working again, so I reverted to another commit.
This commit is now what I am working on.

Currently, done with step 5. going onto step 6.

# PS: DON'T FORGET ABOUT HEROKU
