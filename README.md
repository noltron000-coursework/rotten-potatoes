# Rotten Potatoes
Project for backend web 1.1 in MakeSchool.

Currently most assets work properly, but they are using an old technology (AJAX over Fetch).

Indeed, the youtube trailer will not work correctly either.

Otherwise, all features seem to work as intended.

If you spot an error, mark an issue on my github!
